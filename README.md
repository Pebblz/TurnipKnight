# Turnip Knight
Game-Jam 2020 students from New England Institute of Technology in collaboration with the Izzy Foundation bring you “Turnip Knight”. Enter a medieval world of food as you guide a small turnip knight through a castle banquet.

Watch out for forks, sticky syrup, and other tricks and traps. Collect bits of cheese, meat, and apples to increase your score as you make your way across the castle banquet!
